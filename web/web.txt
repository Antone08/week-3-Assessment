Essentially the internet is a network of connected computers that communicate between one another.
The way this comminucation occurs is through wired or wireless methods. the wired method would require an excess amount of wires and each conmputer would need many ports to make this method work.
the wireless method only needs one router and one port for the computer so that it can wirelessly contact other computers and makes communication effective.
Eventually once a newtwork is established you can then access content through iP addresses or Web addresses(WWW.) so that you can request information or send information.
 
When clicking on a link you are requesting information which is then being sent to a server.
The server then starts processing the request and then when its done it sends the the requested information. 
The information being sent and requested is done in packets which means that the information is coming in smaller bits of information instead of one huge file. 
If im not mistaken this is for the sake of effectivness for the data being transferred.
